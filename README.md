# Ball_Detection_Segmentation_and_Tracking_CV_Up

# [Repository Title]

This repository contains implementations of various computer vision techniques focusing on ball detection, segmentation, feature extraction, and tracking. These tasks are essential components in applications such as sports analytics, interactive games, and robotic vision systems.

## Overview

The repository is divided into several key sections:
1. **Image Segmentation and Detection** - Techniques to identify and segment ball objects using conventional computer vision methods.
2. **Feature Calculation** - Extracting shape and texture features from segmented ball images.
3. **Object Tracking** - Implementing a Kalman filter to track the motion of a ball based on noisy observations.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-image
